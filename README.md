# Flask Application

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flask application.

### 1. Dependencies

First, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary Python packages for the application.
### 2. Setup Database

Once the dependencies are installed, initialize the database by running:

```bash
flask --app flaskr init-db
```
This command will set up the necessary database tables.
### 3. Executing the Program
After setting up the database, you can run the application by executing the following command:
```bash
flask --app flaskr run
```
This will start the Flask development server. The application will be accessible at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
